I build this project in order to code a basic ETL only using Python and SQLite. 

The project is divided into :

Extracting Data from a website using BeautifulSoup and Store in a dataframe 

Transforming Data using Python 

Load the data into a SQLite database and a CSV file

After that we run multiple queries to check the data in the database

By doin this project I learned how to use BeautifulSoup, python and SQLite to build a basic ETL process.
